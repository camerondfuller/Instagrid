Experience from the project:
This project taught me how to use APIs and ajax methods to dynamically display content. Learning about the Instagram API was a really amazing experience. I can see how I would be able to use APIs in future applications and websites.
This project also taught me to build a website from a mobile first perspective. By utilizing Sass and breakpoints, the mobile first aspect of the project was really simple.
Overall, while this is a very simple website, the functionality of it makes it very fun to use.
